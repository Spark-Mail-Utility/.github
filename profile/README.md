## About Spark Mail
Spark Mail is a modern email client reimagined for both individual productivity and team collaboration. It tackles inbox overload by intelligently categorizing your emails, allowing you to triage quickly. Features like "Smart Inbox" separate newsletters and notifications from personal and important messages, while "Snooze" and "Send Later" give you control over when you deal with emails. For teams, Spark introduces a revolutionary layer of collaboration directly on top of email, enabling shared inboxes, internal discussions about specific emails, and delegated follow-ups, all while maintaining the security and privacy of your accounts.

The application stands out by respecting that email is often a collaborative tool, not just a personal one. Its team features are seamlessly integrated, allowing colleagues to work together on customer support, partnership inquiries, or project communications without the chaos of forwarding and CC'ing. For power users, features like powerful search, natural language processing for scheduling, and extensive customization make it a highly capable replacement for default mail apps. Spark successfully blends intelligent automation, a beautiful design, and unique collaborative powers into a single, cohesive email experience.
